# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
### The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, based on their birth date. And I create four different csv files for preparing for the upcoming "silver tsunami."

## Results:
- 1. With the retirment_titles table, we are able to see every eligible for retirement employee and the period they have worked at each position over the course of their career.

 [retirment_titles](/Data/retirement_titles.csv)
- 2. With the unique_title table, it is similar with the first table, however, it is only shows the most recent title for employees. As picture shows, for 10004 of (emp_no) employee number, title only shows senior engineer, without duplicate of emp_no.
